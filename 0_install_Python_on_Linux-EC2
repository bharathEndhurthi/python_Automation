Install python on Linux-Ec2?
----------------------------

Step1:	https://www.python.org/downloads/source/

step2:	select which version do you want to install & copy the link(right click & copy link) of "Gzipped source tarball" of that version

step3:	SSH in to your EC2
	
	-check whether wget is installed or not	--> which wget

	-if not installed, install wget		--> yum install wget -y


step4: install python .tar version (you have already copied it from the official python's website)

	--> wget https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.7.0/Python-3.7.0.tgz    (copied link from website)

step5: unzip/untar the installed python

	--> tar -xvf  Python-3.7.0.tgz

step6:	To work with python we need some extra dependencies, so install them

	--> yum install gcc openssl-devel bzip2-devel libffi-devel -y

step7:	go to installed,(untared) python and run configure

	--> cd Python-3.7.0
  	--> ./configure

step:8	run a command make to compile the code of installed python

	--> make

step9:	install python
	--> make altinstall  		(here "alt" in altinstall--> if you have already installed any other version of python in the system the latest installation will not disturb that old version of python)



step10:	by default it will be installed in the location /usr/local/bin/

	--> ls -lrt /usr/local/bin/


step:11	to run/make it work your latest python add/export /usr/local/bin PATH to ~/.bashrc file.
	--> echo "PATH=\$PATH:/usr/local/bin" >> ~/.bashrc
	--> export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/bin


step12: make a soft copy to the python3.7  (because to create a short name instead of using python3.7 for easy-use-case purpose.)
 	cd /usr/local/bin
	ln -s python3.7 python3
	ln -s pip3.7 pip3


step13: Now you have Successfully installed Python3.7 on Linux-Ec2 Machine
	
	Test:
		search anywhere from the Machine
		
			python3 --version	(gives python version)

			pip --version		(gives pip version)
